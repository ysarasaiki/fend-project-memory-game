# How to contribute
The files in this repository are used as the starting point for all students. Because we want students to write the majority of the code themselves, pull requests (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.

# Contributing
Please discuss any changes with me prior to making any changes! I can be reached via issue or email.

## Pull Request Process
# Update README.md with information about any changes
# Increase the new version number in any files and README.md
# Please merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off from me
